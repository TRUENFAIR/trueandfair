              4. How We Protect Your Information
            </div>

            <div className="text-justify  md:ml-4 mb-4 font-bah">
              The TF takes what it believes to be commercially reasonable
              physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect
              personal information in accordance with applicable law. However,
              since no security system is impenetrable and “perfect security”
              does not exist on the Internet, we cannot guarantee the security
              of personal information including sensitive personal data or
              information.  We have put in place procedures to respond to any
              suspected personal data breach and will notify you when we are
              legally required to do so.
