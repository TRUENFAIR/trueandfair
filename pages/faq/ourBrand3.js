                Sampling including analytics tools will be developed by True and
                Fair. It is still not decided on offering the same along with
                ADAT since the type of tool to be used in an engagement will
                vary based on the accounting application used by the audit
                client. It is likely that these tools will be made available
                separately on a separate subscription.
