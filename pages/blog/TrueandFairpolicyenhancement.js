            I am deeply passionate about audits and the quality of audits
            therein. As outlined earlier True and Fair has developed two sets of
            policies - a basic and enhanced version. The latter are for firms
            looking to fundamentally change the way audits are performed and
            reported. Here is a detailed explanation of the enhancements that
            will be included in the quality policies of True and Fair.

            The word ‘audit’ is derived from the Latin word audire which means
            ‘to hear’. Wikipedia says{" "}
            <span className="italic">
              {" "}
              “During medieval times, when manual bookkeeping was prevalent,
              auditors in Britain used to hear the accounts read out for them
              and checked that the organisation&#39;s personnel were not
              negligent or fraudulent.”
            </span>
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Whilst I don’t know when the objectives of audits were first
            instituted, I do believe that providing reasonable assurance as a
            primary goal is clearly outdated.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Stakeholders these days expect significantly more than reasonable
            assurance. While I do agree that no auditor can give absolute
            assurance due to the inherent limitations, continuing to call it
            reasonable assurance is not aligned to needs of the hour.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Today’s auditor does more work, has a more meticulous process to
            perform audits, and spends a fair amount of time evaluating
            evidence. Auditors today also rely heavily on tools and technology
            to analyse data and in effect tests 100% of the population
            susceptible to risk.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Now considering all the various tasks performed by auditors it is
            only fair to say they should be able to confidently state in their
            report that the audit{" "}
            <span className="underline italic">
              {" "}
              “provides an assurance, subject to the inherent limitation in an
              audit due to management override of control and the inherent
              concept of materiality underlying an audit, that the financial
              statements present a true and fair view.”

          <p className="leading-loose  font-bold mb-4 mt-4  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            2. Division of Responsibility:
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            When a company appoints an auditor to audit their financial
            statements shareholders expect them to take full responsibility
            including that of the consolidated financial statements.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Section 143 (1) of the Companies Act, 2013 states that ‘the auditor
            of a company which is a holding company shall also have the right of
            access to the records of all its subsidiaries so far as it relates
            to the consolidation of its financial statements with that of its
            subsidiaries.’
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            In my reading, the right of access has been provided only to enable
            the auditor to perform his duty since section 143 talks of both
            right and duty of the auditor.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            SA 600 - “Using the Work of Another Auditor” permits the division of
            responsibility in an audit and allows the principal auditor to rely
            on the work of another auditor subject to performing certain
            procedures. ICAI states that it has not adopted ISA 600 which does
            not permit division of responsibility by the principal auditor.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Joint audits: SA 299 “Joint Audit of Financial Statements” a unique
            policy in the SAs in India (as there is no corresponding standard
            under ISA) also permits division of responsibility, with each
            auditor taking responsibility only for the areas audited by him.
            Such a division or responsibility, in my view, is against the spirit
            and objective of joint audit which by virtue of the term must have
            the perspective of two auditors.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose  mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Permitting a division of responsibility defeats the primary
            objective of joint audits.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose  mt-2 md:ml-8 text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            True and Fair’s audit practice policies do not support division of
            responsibility. Though the audit report may state division of
            responsibility in form, in substance the audit report will indicate
            that the principal auditor and / or joint auditors is taking the
            responsibility for full financial statements subject to any basic
            negligence by the other auditor.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            The auditor will prepare a detailed description in his report that
            will list out all the steps taken before placing reliance on the
            work of the other / joint auditor.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose   text-justify font-bold mb-4 mt-4   font-bah text-black ">
            3. Focus on fraud:
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            “An auditor is not a blood hound but a watchdog.” This is a common
            statement made to describe the role of an auditor. While it is true
            that the scope of an auditor is not to perform an investigation to
            detect fraud, it is equally true that the audit should consider,
            plan and perform adequate steps to detect fraud during the
            performance of his audit.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose  mt-2 md:ml-8 text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            True and Fair will enable audit firms to get audit support from
            forensic auditors. We will also mandate chartered accountant firms
            to identify certain employees of the firm as fraud specialists and
            provide them with necessary training to perform their role
            objectively.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            It is ironic to note that fraud has not been considered as a key
            audit matter in any audit reports even though auditors are expected
            to spend significant time to mitigate such risk. True and Fair’s
            audit practice policies will place adequate emphasis on
            consideration of frauds in audits. We will list out exhaustive
            procedures to detect and mitigate such risks apart from detailed
            guidelines on reporting in audits. As a first step True and Fair’s
            audit practice policies will consider related party transactions,
            management estimates and going concern as presumed fraud risk with a
            rebuttable presumption.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose  font-bold mb-4 mt-4  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            4. Sampling:
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            True and Fair’s policy on audit practice permits audit sampling only
            in the area of controls and in substantive testing of account
            balances with low risk. For all other areas, True and Fair’s
            policies require performance of data analytics and 100% testing of
            the interested population impacted by the risk.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose font-bold mb-4 mt-4   text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            5. Need for other professionals in an audit:
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            The engagement team comprises of the engagement partner, manager,
            other staff, IT audit, forensic and valuation specialists along with
            engagement quality control reviewer, True and Fair’s policy on audit
            practice encourages engagement teams to be guided by an independant
            industry specialist and a specialist to review the quality of audit.
            It is preferred that this exercise of the specialist performing a
            review is carried out before the report is issued in order to
            improve the quality of the audit.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose font-bold mb-4 mt-4   text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            6. Auditor’s reporting:
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            Present day, audit reports are templatised and are used commonly by
            all audit firms. These reports are similar in their look and feel to
            the extent that if you hide the name of the company in an audit
            report you will not be able to identify the company it belongs to.
            These report templates do not provide meaningful information to its
            users. I believe that the reporting obligations for auditors as
            prescribed under the laws and regulations are only the minimum
            requirements and the auditor should enhance the information
            contained in the report to make it meaningful..
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2 md:ml-8  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            In light of this, True and Fair will encourage audit firms to issue
            a ‘talking’ audit report to the Board of the company it is auditing.
            Such a ‘talking’ audit report may be included in the annual report
            of the entity and disseminated at large.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose  mt-2 md:ml-8 text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            The ‘talking’ audit report shall describe in brief the entire audit
            life cycle for the company right from appointment, to planning,
            audit performance and reporting. It will also include significant
            matters of discussion with management, details of fees proposed,
            negotiated and finalised by the management, auditor’s overall
            conclusion on the fees and the like.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-loose mt-2   text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
            We will provide an exhaustive library of technical guidance,
            practice aids, standard formats relating to audit which will be
            hosted on the cloud.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-loose mb-12  text-justify  font-bah text-black ">
          True and Fair plans to launch the service offerings for Phase 1 by March 2023 so that audit firms

that our services will enable audit firms to make a compelling and competitive pitch for
themselves in the audit universe.
